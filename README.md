# JavaScript Jest Skeleton

This is a skeleton or template for writing JavaScript-Applications 
guided by tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
You'll need [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to be installed.  
To get started first clone this repository into a project folder of your choice.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/andrebauer/js-jest-skeleton.git your-project-name
```

Alternatively you can download the latest [ZIP-Archive](https://github.com/andrebauer/js-jest-skeleton/archive/master.zip).

Inside your repository run `npm install`.

```sh
$ npm install
```

After everything is set up, you can run your first test. It should pass. 

```sh
$ npm test
```

Now start writing a first test for your app...
